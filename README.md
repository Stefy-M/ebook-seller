## I have gained a liking towards NodeJs and its many capabilities. My goal is to get it mastered to the best of my ability by creating small apps using tutorials online. Ultimately i think i am hoping this strategy will give me enough knowledge to create things on my own. This app was guided from a video online [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT3_zT97_1g) and edited to my liking. I have plans on writing my own books someday so this knowledge will be useful in the future

### App was created using NodeJs and the Stripe API for credit card transactions
